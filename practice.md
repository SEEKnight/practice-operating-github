 							        Establish Confidence

​	I used to hate being called upon in class mainly because I did not like attention drawn
to myself. And unless otherwise assigned a seat by the teacher, I always choose to sit at
the back of the classroom.
​	All this changed after I joined a sports team. It began when a teacher suggested I try
out for the basketball team. At first I thought it was a crazy idea because I did not have a
good sense of balance, nor did I have the ability to keep pace with the others on the team
and they would tease me. But for the teacher who kept insisting on my "going for it", I
would not have decided to give a try.
​	Getting up the courage to go to the try out was only the half of it! When first started
attending the practice sessions, I did not even know the rules of the game, much less what I
was doing. Sometimes I would get confused and take a shot at the wrong direction — which
made me feel really stupid. Fortunately, I was not the only one "new" at the game, so I
decided to focus on learning the game, do my best at each practice session, and not be too
hard on myself for the things I did not know "just yet".
​	I practiced and practiced. Soon I knew the rules and the "moves", Being part of a team
was fun and motivating. Very soon the competitive part in me was winning over my lack of
confidence. With time, I learned how to play and made friends in the process — friends who
respected my efforts to work hard and be a team player. I never had so much fun!
​	With my improved self-confidence comes more praise from teachers and classmates. I have
gone from "hiding" in the back of the classroom and not wanting to call attention to myself,
to raising my hand — even when I sometimes was not one hundred percent sure I had the right
answer. Now I have more self-confidence in myself.

                                The hazard of heel shoes

    Check out any woman's wardrobe and you will be sure to find at least one pair of
highheel shoes there. After all, which woman can resist wearing something that makes her
look taller and her legs appear longer? Unfortunately, those high heel shoes women love
so much live up to their name, and can end up doing more damage than you can imagine to
the spine and lower back——if care is not taken. 
    Murlowska, a therapist, is familiar with the consequences of wearing high heels. A
majority of patients who arrive at Murlowska's office come to her with back and lower
back problems. Very often the problems are the result of not walking properly in high
heels or choosing the wrong kind of footwear.
    "I know women love wearing high heels butthey can cause extreme damage to the body,"
Murlowska says. "I recently had a patient who had a terrible fall while walking in high
heels and twisted her knee. She did not think much of it at the time, but the next
morning she woke up to find her knee swollen and painful."
    If a woman walks in heelshigher than five centimeters, several pressure points develop
in various parts of the body which experience stress. Essentially, a woman wearing high
heels is attempting to balance her entire body on a very small area. This causes extreme
stress on the muscles of the legs while increasing the chances of the ankle getting
twisted. This can result in damage to the knee ligaments and tendons. High heels force
the rest of the foot into an unnatural down-turned position. Consequently, the rest of
the body has to adjust itself in order to stay balanced. The lower part of the spine as
well as the hip bone tilts forward while the upper spine and the neck tilts back in
order to maintain balance."
    Over a period of time, the hip bone also gets affected because of the change in the
center of gravity as a result of wearing high heels.

                                        Life's Corner

    All of us have gone down the wrong road at one time or another, and sometimes it has
taken us too long to make that right turn. Sometimes we never do. But usually, we finally
put on the turn signal and go around the corner, happily moving down the road until we need
to our course yet again.
    My friend Helen up in Syracuse has taken the lesson to heart. Helen is in her ninety's
and she still drives. The key is that she makes only right-hand turns. A clever strategy.
Yes, it takes her longer to get from one place to another by making only right-hand turns,
she stays close to the curb and never finds herself out in some crossing trying to turn left
against oncoming traffic. It works. So far she always made it home from her errands safe and
sound.
    Like Helen, we all adapt with age. My mother, who turns eighty-six next month, has
unwillingly thrown away her three-inch heels, A while back, she realized she could not
depend on them any longer and to more sensible, though boring, flats. I am sure there will
come a time when even I will realize it is time to put on that turn signal. With any luck,
we all become a little bit wiser while moving down life's highway and grow to realize what
Helen already knows.
    Just make a right turn.

                                    Great Expectation

    Pete Rose was a great baseball player. Though I have never met him, he taught me
something valuable that changed my life.
    Pete was being interviewed in spring training the year he was about to break Ty Cobb's
all-time hits record. Suddenly one reporter asked home, "Pete, you only need seventy-eight
hits to reach your nearest goal. How many innings do you think it will take you to get the
seventy-eight hits?" Without hesitation, Pete just stared at the reporter and said
"Seventy-eight." The reporter yelled back, "Ah, come on, Pete, you did not think you will
get seventy-eight hits in seventy-eight at-bats, do you?" Mr. Rose, calmly shared his
philosophy with the reporters who were anxiously waiting for his reply to the claim. "Every
time I step up yo the plate, I expect to get a git! Unless I have it in mind, I have no
right to step into the batter's box! It is a positive expectation that has enabled me to get
all of the hits in the first place." 
    When I thought about Pete Rose's idea and how it applied to everyday life, I felt a
little embarrassed. As a business person, I was hoping to make my sales quotas. As a father,
I was hoping to be a good dad. As a married man, I was hoping to be a good husband. The
truth was that I was a fairly good salesperson, I was not so bad of a father, and I was an
okay husband. I immediately decided that being okay was not enough!I wanted to be a great
salesperson, a great father, and a great husband. I changed my attitude to one of the
positive expectations, and the results were amazing. I was fortunate enough to win a few
sales trips, Iwon Coach of the Year in my son's baseball league, and I share a loving
relationship with my wife, Karen, with whom I am determined to enjoy the rest of my life!
    Thanks, Mr. Rose!
